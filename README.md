# Frozen-Themed Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

A single-page portfolio inspired by Disney's **Frozen** with a floating 3D assistant, frosted-glass UI, and aurora background.

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repo named `<username>.github.io` (or any repo if you prefer project pages).
2. Upload these files (or drag-drop the whole folder).
3. If using a project repo, enable Pages: **Settings → Pages → Source: `Deploy from a branch` → Branch: `main` (`/root`)**.
4. Replace `assets/assistant.png` with your 3D character (transparent PNG/WebP). Use ~1000px height for crispness.
5. Edit content in `index.html` (Projects, Skills, Experience, Contact).

## Customize
- Colors are defined in `:root` in `style.css`.
- The typewriter text lives in `script.js` as `fullText`.
- Nav sections are semantic and accessible.

## Credits
- Aurora & frosted effects: pure CSS.
- Snowfall: lightweight CSS dots + animation.
